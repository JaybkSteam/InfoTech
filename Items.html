<h1> For the first items i will show and talk about are some good cpu that you can get and information about them.</h1> 
<p> For the first Cpu we have is the AMD Ryzen 5 7600.</p>
<img src="ryzen.png"  id="Photo" alt= "ryzen Pictute"width="300"><br>
<p>Now this cpu is one of the more top picks for cpus that are used for gaming. 
    <br> Now for some facts about this cpu. <br> 
    The Ryzen 5 7600's six cores run at a 3.8 GHz base and 5.1 GHz boost and are fed by 32MB of L3 cache. The chip supports all the standards of a modern processor, including DDR5, PCIe 5.0, and the latest USB connectivity standards. AMD has also added integrated graphics for a basic display out, which is a plus if you need to troubleshoot.
    <br> 
    <br>
</p>
<h1>Now the second Cpu is the  Intel Core i5-13400 </h1>
<img src="intel2.png" id="Photo" alt="Intel Picture"width="300"><br>
<p>The  Intel core i5-13400  has six P-cores that support hyper-threading and operate at a 2.5 GHz base and 4.6 GHz boost clock. The four e-cores for threaded tasks run up to 3.3 GHz. The 13400 supports leading-edge connectivity with support for DDR4-3200 or up to DDR5-4800 memory, along with 16 lanes of PCIe 5.0 and an additional four lanes of PCIe 4.0 from the chip for M.2 SSDs.
  <br> However one downside about this Cpu is that it requires you run a s LGA1700 motherboard
  and its Not fully overclockable.
</p>

<p> Now if you have have read and seen some of the info about the Intel core i5-13400 and theRyzen 5 7600 the two video down below will compare the two in differnet games and the other one will compare and contract the two cpus and disscus some postives and negatives about them.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Now the next cpu we will talk about is the Intel Core i9-13900K </h1>

<img src="intel.png" id="Photo" alt="Intel Picture"width="300"><br>

<p> The Intel core i9-13900K The chip comes with eight P-cores that support hyper-threading, and 16 single-threaded E-cores for a total of 24 threads. The P-cores have a 3.0 GHz base, and peak frequencies reach an amazing 5.8 GHz with Turbo Boost Max 3.0 (this feature is only active on P-cores). Meanwhile, the E-cores have a 2.2 GHz base and stretch up to 4.3 GHz via the standard Turbo Boost 2.0 algorithms. The chip is also equipped with 36MB of L3 cache and 32MB of L2.</p>
<p> However there is also some negative about this Cpu just like in the other cpus. For example because this cpu reguire so much energy and power </p>
